**Hacking tools for hacking nerds**

---

## 🤔 Keep penetration testing fun!

We believe closed-source hacking tools are boring. Penetration testing should be fun, right? Here at Pangio Technologies, we bring you the fun tools you need for your fun job.

## Hardware

Pangio Technologies develops the Pangio FAP R1, a forward attack platform that might very well be your next swiss army knife when it comes to on-premises penetration testing.

## Software

Not in the mood for a new hacking device? Pangio Technologies publishes all its hacking software right here on GitHub.

## ♀️ Note on protecting women

Devices with features similar as those of the tools we're developping (Apple Airtags, etc.) have been used in a systemic way in acts of harassment, stalking, and violence against women. Important decisions have to be made regarding what features to implement so as to not endanger women and keep the Pangio a pentesting device.

Pangio Technologies is fully committed to making it as hard as possible for ill-intended people to use its devices against women.
